    <p>Advanced Rocketry adds a plethora of alien biomes to decorate your planets with for when the Vanilla Biomes won\'t cut it. Their IDs can be changed in the advancedRocketry.cfg file.</p>
    <br />
    <h2>Hot Dry Rock</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/hot_dry_rock.png" /><p>The Hot Dry Rock biome is meant to resemble the surface of a rocky, barren planet similar to Mars or Venus. The surface is covered in Oxidized Ferric Sand, but is otherwise featureless. It has a biome temperature of 0.9 similar to Mushroom Islands.</p>
    <h2>Moon</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/moon.png" /><p>The Moon biome is meant to resemble something closer to the surface of an atmosphere-less, grey planet similar to Earth\'s Moon, Mercury or a Dwarf Planet. It is not that different from the Hot Dry Rock biome, but it is covered in Moon Dust and has a biome temperature of 0.3.</p>
    <h2>Alien Forest</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/alien_forest.png" /><p>The Alien Forest is the first fictional biome Advanced Rocketry has. It resembles a forest with blue grass and blue trees growing leaves that emit some light.</p>
    <h2>Crystal Chasms</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/crystal_chasms.png" /><p>The Crystal Chasms biome has a biome temperature of 0.1, and is accordingly covered in a layer of snow on top of a layer of ice. In this biome, large crystals of multiple colors can generate. There is currently no use for these crystal blocks, however.</p>
    <h2>Deep Swamp</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/deep_swamp.png" /><p>The Deep Swamp looks similar enough to an Earth-like biome, with a temperature of 0.9. However, strange trees grow here with roots that can dig deep into the soil. WARNING: As of the latest version, these large trees are not very stable. Their leaves will decay after being generated, which may cause excessive block updates.</p>
    <h2>Marsh</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/marsh.png" /><p>The Marsh is a strange biome with deep pits filled with water. Other than that, the only useful thing the biome has to give are lilypads.</p>
    <h2>Ocean Spires</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/ocean_spires.png" /><p>The Ocean Spires biome is similar to the Marsh, except the bits of land get taller at the top, and they stick up above the water level quite a bit. </p>
    <h2>Space</h2>
    <p>This is the biome that space station dimensions are filled with. Besides a hot biome temperature of 1.0, it\'s not very interesting.</p>
    <h2>Stormland</h2>
    <img align="left" src="../img/stormland.png" /><p>The Stormland is a biome covered in burnt out trees made of Charcoal Logs. The grass here is colored black, and the biome seems to resemble a forest that was burnt down at some point. It has a biome temperature of 0.9.</p>';
