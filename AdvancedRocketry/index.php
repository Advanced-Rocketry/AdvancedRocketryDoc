<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the documentation page for Advanced
Rocketry!&nbsp; The mod is still in alpha and should be entering beta
soon.</p>
<p>Advanced Rocketry is a Minecraft mod designed to add random or
player specified planets to the game.&nbsp; These planets each have
unique properties such as Atmosphere Density, Distance from the sun,
Atmosphere composition, Average Temperature, and size.&nbsp; Players
can build rockets out of blocks to travel to these other worlds.<br />
