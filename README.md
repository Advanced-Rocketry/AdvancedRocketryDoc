## Adding a new Block page

1. Rename the page template (https://github.com/zmaster587/AdvancedRocketryDoc/blob/master/AdvancedRocketry/Templates/Template.php) to the name of the block to document (For example "FuelTank.php")
2. Fill in the title fields with the name of the block, the mainContent field with the text to be displayed, and the infobarContent with material to be displayed on the sidebar


## Image Guidelines
